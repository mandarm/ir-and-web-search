Lecture 1: Introduction, overview of applications.
           Basic idea: keyword search.
           Indexing: tokenisation, stopword removal, stemming, phrase
           identification.
           Boolean retrieval, ranked retrieval, vector space model:
           term weighting, very brief overview of axiomatic approach
           to term weighting.

Lecture 2: Language modeling for IR: query likelihood, KL divergence, smoothing.

Lecture 3: Crawling, focused crawling, Nutch
           Move this closer to 10?

Lecture 4: Index structures, index creation.
           Roughly: MRS, chapters 2, 4 ?

Lecture 5: Indexing and retrieval using Lucene.

Lecture 6: Evaluation: recall, precision, average precision, NDCG, other
           commonly used metrics; test collections, evaluation forums, sound 
           experimental methods.

Lecture 7: Query expansion: relevance feedback, Rocchio's method,
           variations, pseudo relevance feedback; relevance based 
           language models and variations.

Lecture 8: Latent Semantic Analysis, word embeddings: overview and 
           applications in IR.

Lecture 9: Web document preprocessing: parsing, segmentation,
            deduplication, shingling.

Lecture 10: Link analysis: hubs and authorities, PageRank.

Lecture 11: Learning to rank

Lecture 12: Text classification ?
